<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Endotracheal Tube Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cuffed</li><li>Uncuffeds</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The endotracheal tube market comprises two main types: cuffed and uncuffed tubes. Cuffed tubes feature an inflatable cuff that seals the airway, preventing air leaks and minimizing the risk of aspiration, making them suitable for patients requiring artificial ventilation. Uncuffed tubes, on the other hand, do not have a cuff and are generally used in pediatric care or for patients with low ventilation needs, allowing for ease of placement and reduced trauma during intubation.</p></p>
